	I found the blurry trails left by weapon attacks in Devil May Cry 5 to be very interesting 
and pleasing to the eye. When the player character, in the case of the screenshot, Dante, performs any 
of his attacks with any of his weapons, the weapons are followed by some kind of mesh that distorts the
space directly behind the weapon. This is perhaps to simulate the real-life motion blur that occurs when 
a something moves by very quickly. The moving object moves from one position to the other and appears to 
distort or blur the things behind it as it moves. This effect serves to illustrate the velocity and force 
with which Dante is using to swing or command his weapons and give more visual impact and "oomph" to every 
single one of Dante's weapon attacks.
	As the effect distorts whatever happens to be behind it, the effect changes depending on the position
of the camera. Whatever pixels happen to fall within the area affected by the effect in the scene in relation to 
the position of the camera are stretched and distorted in some way. The effect was perhaps achieved by having some 
kind of trail mesh connected to each weapon. Based on the animation, the trails begins and ends at two specific points,
covering a specific area of the screen. The pixels that happen to fall within the trail are then recorded and a shader
processes each recorded pixel through some kind of algorithm that moves the pixels' colors in certain directions based 
on camera position and the position of the trails starting and ending points, resulting in the bent, wavy distortion 
of in-scene objects such as the environment as seen in the screenshot.
