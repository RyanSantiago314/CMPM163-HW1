# CMPM163-HW1

This project demonstrates basic knowledge of Unity as well
as the ability to apply shaders to objects in scenes. 
Part A features three objects each using a different shader
that alters the fragment and vertices of each. Part B demonstrates
the use of a shader to perform a image processing on a given image.
The image used is an original piece of mine. Part C uses a
cellular automata algorithm to form an interesting pattern. 
Within it I created a predator-prey system each represented by
red and white cells respectively.
